# Tools Ryan uses

## Equipment

- I use a 15-inch 2017 MacBook Pro, Magic Mouse, and Magic Keyboard. My laptop sits on the [mStand by Rain Design](https://www.raindesigninc.com/mstand.html).
- My mic is a [Rode Podcaster](http://www.rode.com/microphones/podcaster). It sits in the [Rode PSM1 Shock Mount](http://www.rode.com/accessories/psm1), attached to the [Rode PSA1 Boom Arm](http://www.rode.com/accessories/psa1).
- I sit for way too long in a Herman Miller Aeron Size B. A good chair is something I don't compromise on.
- My light is an [Elgato Key Light](https://www.elgato.com/en/gaming/key-light). Pictured is a [Neewer CN-160](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004TJ6JH6/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1) but I have since upgraded.
- My second screen is a [Dell UltraSharp U2715H 27-Inch](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00P0EQD1Q/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1). It's alright.
- My mouse / desk pad is the [SteelSeries QcK Gaming Surface - XXL Thick Cloth](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00WAA2704/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1).
- For gaming, I use a [DREVO Excalibur 84-Key Cherry MX](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01N6GBUQE/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1) keyboard and [Final Mouse](https://finalmouse.com/products/air-blue?variant=9835888050212).
- My desk is a [Varidesk 60" Electric](https://www.amazon.com/VARIDESK-Electric-Reclaimed-3-Button-Settings/dp/B079ZBGHYZ/ref=asc_df_B079ZBGHYZ/?tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=312159782595&hvpos=1o1&hvnetw=g&hvrand=12110749741322452766&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9003949&hvtargid=pla-568784689613&psc=1) standing desk.

## Coding and design tools

- I use [VSCode](visualstudio.com) with the [Gruvbox Theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tomphilbin.gruvbox-themes) for writing code.
- My preferred terminal is [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/) with [Itermocil](https://github.com/TomAnthony/itermocil).
- [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) has fundamentally changed the way I design on teams.

## Productivity Apps

- I take notes using [Notion](https://www.notion.so/).
- [CloudApp](https://www.getcloudapp.com/) helps me visually communicate what's on my screen.
- [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) has provided a lot of value to my teams and I when creating APIs.
- [IconJar](https://geticonjar.com/) helps me keep my SVG assets organized.
- [Vanilla](https://matthewpalmer.net/vanilla/) - "Hide menu bar icons on your Mac."
- [FontPlop](https://www.fontplop.com/) - "fontplop is an OSX/macOS application which takes ttf and otf files and outputs a webfont bundle"
